# Machine-Learning-Model-Suite

This repository contains a comprehensive suite of machine learning models showcasing the application of Classification, Regression, and Clustering algorithms. Each model is designed to address specific real-world problems, and the code is structured for easy understanding and adaptation.


#  Introduction
Machine Learning Model Suite is a collection of various machine learning algorithms implemented using Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib. The goal of this repository is to provide a platform for understanding and applying core machine learning concepts for different tasks like Classification, Regression, and Clustering.

Algorithms
Classification Models : These models aim to predict categorical outcomes from data and are suited for tasks like spam detection, image recognition, and medical diagnosis.

1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3. Decision Trees
4. Random Forest
5. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
6. Naive Bayes

Regression Models: These models are used for predicting continuous values and are ideal for problems like house price prediction, stock market analysis, and sales forecasting.

1. Linear Regression
2. Polynomial Regression
3. Decision Tree Regression
4. Support Vector Regression (SVR)

Clustering Models : Clustering is useful for identifying groups or patterns in unlabelled data, commonly applied in customer segmentation and anomaly detection.

1. K-Means Clustering
2. Hierarchical Clustering
